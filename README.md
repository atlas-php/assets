# Atlas Assets
**Atlas Assets** is a Laravel package that centralizes file management into a unified system for uploading, organizing, storing, and retrieving assets across any storage backend. It provides dynamic pathing, polymorphic model associations, and a consistent API for working with files—while remaining fully storage-agnostic and optimized for S3-based workflows.
